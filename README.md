# CSS-card-game-tutorial

This CSS card game is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8mpXIUHjWoMAAgoCEinL0R) from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw). None of the code is mine -- I wish it were, because it's really cool, but it's not mine.
